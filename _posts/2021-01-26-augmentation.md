Like many, my journey into creative coding was guided by Daniel Shiffman’s Nature of Code. When it first came out in 2012, it was one of the few resources which explained the core concepts of coding in an easy to understand manner. At the end of a chapter, Daniel urged the reader to implement the concepts by creating a ‘pond’, an ecosystem with intelligent agents which would act of their own accord, and employ a genetic system, much like real life. I never got around to actually creating this ecosystem, partly because it was a difficult undertaking.

I tried to create a few variations, but never managed to figure out how to create intelligent agents capable of interacting with each other. My interest in creating an artificial ecosystem didn’t fade, and I finally decided to create one, but with a unique tweak. Most Artificial Life (AL) systems replicated reality, or at the very least, followed the same rules of predation, and natural selection. I wanted to explore alternative metrics of natural selection. Would being nice to each other help the species as a whole thrive? Or is the idea of the selfish gene far too efficient? My intent with the AL system was to create an homeostatic system which would then be induced with behaviours such as sharing, community, and respect for the environment, with the hopes of comparing the tweaked systems with the baseline to observe if there were any changes, if at all.
