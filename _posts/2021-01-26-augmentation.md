# Augmentation

To augment is to make something greater by adding to it, or increasing it. Although this may be a simple definition, it does ask many questions. The chief of which is, should the augmentation happen at all? Can the augmentation even happen? What are the positives and negatives of the augmentation? Augmentation also implies an existing boundary or limit-what does that look like and why is it so?

These are the questions which will define the augmentation, and make sense of it. 



Perhaps augmentation can also be defined as a verb-to extend, to access, to break barriers, to embrace, to create, to enrich.
